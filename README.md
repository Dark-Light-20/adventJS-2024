# adventJS-2024 Challenges Solutions

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to **25** challenges proposed by [Midudev](https://x.com/midudev) on the website [adventJS.dev](https://adventjs.dev). The purpose of the challenges is to improve JavaScript (mainly), TypeScript and Python skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Installation

To run the solutions, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine (or Python3). Once you have Node.js (or Python3) installed, clone this repository and run each solution `.js` or `.ts` (or `.py`) file.

_Note:_ To run TypeScript solutions with ease you need to install globally the `typescript` and `ts-node` packages:

```bash
npm install -g typescript ts-node
```

## Usage

Each challenge is contained in its own _instructions_.md file and its own _solution_.js file. You can run a specific challenge by using Node.js to execute the file. For example, to run Challenge 1, you would use the following command:

```bash
node solutions/js/01.js
```

```bash
ts-node solutions/ts/01.ts
```

```bash
python3 solutions/python/01.py
```

## Languages

The solutions can be made with JavaScript, TypeScript or Python. I'll try to made all 25 challenges with the 3 options :3

_For TypeScript initially I'm gonna use the same JavaScript code, making type checking changes when needed._

_For Python initially I'm gonna translate the JavaScript code, using special python functions to replace js array methods._
